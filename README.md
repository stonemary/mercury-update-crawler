# mercury-update-crawler

This is a wrapper of the update crawler's cook in [@Yingqi1990](https://github.com/Yingqi1990/)'s [Douban_crawler_recommender](https://github.com/Yingqi1990/Douban_crawler_recommender). 
It was seperated from the above repo for AWS opsworks deployment.

Things added so far:
- application.py such that the crawler can be ran as a script
- added requirements file

包装了一下[@Yingqi1990](https://github.com/Yingqi1990/)'s [Douban_crawler_recommender](https://github.com/Yingqi1990/Douban_crawler_recommender) 里关于update crawler的代码,以便于使用Opsworks deploy.
